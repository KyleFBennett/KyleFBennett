- 👋 Hi, I’m @KyleFBennett
- 👀 I’m interested in learning about Python and becoming a software developer one day (not sure what that looks like right now, but that's fine). 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, spending time on tutorials and building my own projects. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on smaller projects and jsut look at how other people work on their projects and see what's out there. 
- 📫 How to reach me kylebennett@live.co.za
